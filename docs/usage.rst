Usage
=====

To use fx-sig-verify in a project::

	import fx_sig_verify


There are also some locally useful utilities which can be installed. At
the command line::

    pip install fx-sig-verify[cli]

That provides the following scripts:

``fx-sig-verify``:
    Command line version of the lambda function. Can be used to check
    local files. It outputs the pass/fail status of the file.

``analyze_cloudwatch``:
    Performs analysis on the CloudWatch logs generated by the lambda
    function. It can perform simple analysis, or extract lines of
    interest for further processing.

``print-pe-certs``:
    This script is from the original code, and is the source of the
    logic for the lambda function. It will print out the certificate
    chain for any file.
